# Statistical-Modelling-on-Meteorites

This project sought to find whether meteorites falling near the equator had statistically significant changes with relations to the year of their observed fall, their mass, and whether the meteorite was found during its fall or after landing. This was done through statistical modelling techniques using the R Programming Language. 

A Dataset from NASA containing over 45,000 meteorite observations was used to achieve this.
The Dataset used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasa/meteorite-landings
